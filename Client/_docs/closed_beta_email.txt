ConnectUO Closed Beta

Body:
Dear ConnectUO Supporter,

	Thanks you for your interest in ConnectUO and participating in the ConnectUO 2.0 Closed Beta.  
	The closed beta should last approximatly 1 week and will then be open to the public. During the 
	beta we are looking for any bugs and inconsistnacies that make ConnectUO unsuable in its 
	current state.  It will be your duty to use ConnectUO and report any and all bugs found to the
	bug forum at http://www.runuo.com/bugs/.  It is important that you check the current bug list 
	to make sure you are not reporting a bug that has already been reported.  Please be sure to 
	include the debug.log in your bug post, you may need to zip it in order to attach it to the
	bug tracker.  During the beta you may see lots of updates to the client (It will tell you when
	it has been updated and ask you to restart), please make sure you are always using the latest 
	version of ConnectUO.  

	Please do not give out this information to anyone until the close beta is complete:
