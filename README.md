#STATE OF THIS PROJECT
---------------------
This is what was to be the next version of ConnectUO 2.  I was refactoring a lot of code, 
replacing libraries, making tons of changes, etc.  I do not know how stable this version 
is, I got distracted by real life in the middle of it and never got around to really testing 
it.  I have made sure that it currently compiles, as long as the libraries noted below are 
installed.  A lot of this code was written years ago, and never modernized, so sorry if its 
sloppy...  I was working to make things a bit more modular (or composite if you will).  This 
is why i started using Ninject.  Hopefully at the very least, this opens up peoples eyes to
how much work is really involved in an app that looks so simple (When you think about it, 
ConnectUO from a users perspective is really simple).
